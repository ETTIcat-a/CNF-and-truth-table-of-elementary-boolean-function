Canonical Disjunctive(Normal) Form and truth table of an elementary boolean function.

Description:
  The code will display truth table and cnf of a 2 variables elementary boolean equation. Use variables 'x', 'y' and operators 'v' as a disjunction(OR logic gate) and '*' as a conjunction(AND logic gate). For not operator use "/'"(apostrophe).
  It is not made for simple function like "x v y" bcs. this one is already simplified.
  DO NOT use brackets to fit all equation[ex. : (x v y) ]. You can use them inside equation [ex. : x v (x v y) ].

Known bugs:
  For one-variable function there will be nothing at output.
  Not really a bug but some part from code can be written into function to speed up compile time and free some memory.
  If you notice any bug/room for improvement send me a short description at marianneamtu37@yahoo.com.
